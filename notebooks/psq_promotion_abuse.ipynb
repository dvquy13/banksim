    "An abuse happens when a user hacks the system to benefit more than he's intended. In this case, a customer can fake multiple new-customer identities for themselves to collect more rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Vietnam, a customer can use one identification card to register at multiple banks. Each bank will have a different system to manage the customers. It's likely that this information is private between banks and with VNPay, so it can be difficult to identify whether a new identity is actually a new customer instead of an existing one using different bank account.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of action should be prevented because it is costly to the company, damages the marketing plan (actual CAC will be 2-3 times higher because [a typical adult in Vietnam opens account at 2 - 3 different banks](https://thebank.vn/blog/7441-moi-nguoi-nen-co-toi-da-bao-nhieu-the-ngan-hang.html)) and affects company reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "An even worse scenario is that the customers take fraud actions professionally. For example, if VNPay allows multiple users link to one banking account, a thief can programmatically fake their IPs and generate virtual mobile devices on their computers. As this happens systematically and in large scale, the damage can be uncontrollable."
